# Project 1 - Programming & Web Fundamentals
## Will consolidate:
*Ruby fundamentals
*TDD (where appropriate)
*OOP
*Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
*Databases with CRUD actions

## MVP - SPEC was adjusted to my project:
### Project TITLE: Animal Rescue Center
Scottish Wild Animal Rescue accepts orphaned, lost, injured wild animals and cares for them until they are healthy enough to go back to a suitable Nature Reserve.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and reserves.
### MVP:
A list of all their animals and their admission date
Mark an animal as being 100% healthy and able to be sent to a reserve
Assign an animal to a new location - a reserve
List all the reserves and the animals that have gone their

### Possible Extensions:
CRUD actions for animals/reserves
Have separate pages for animals ready for being re-homed and ones still being cared for
Search for animals by species, gender etc.
